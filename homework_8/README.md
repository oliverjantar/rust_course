# Server

Chat server is simply a TCP server that accepts connections from clients and broadcasts messages to all connected clients. 

In order to connect to server, client needs to authenticate with a username and password. More detail are in [client](#client) section.

### Database
Server is connected to a postgres database. It uses sqlx to connect to the database and store messages and users. It doesn't store files and images transfered between clients.
The easiest way to startup a postgres database is to run a script `./scripts/init_db.sh`. It will start a docker container with postgres database and runs migrations to create tables.
To run just the migrations, run `SKIP_DOCKER=true ./scripts/init_db.sh`. 

### Configuration
Configuration of the server is done through configuration files in `./configuration/base.yaml` and `./configuration/local.yaml`.
It is possible to start a server on a different port or setup a different database connection.

### Tracing
When running a server, debug tracing logs are sent to the standard output.

### Running a server
Because of the configuration files located in the server directory, you need to `cd` to the s./server before running it.

```
$ cd ./server
$ ./scripts/init_db.sh
$ cargo run --bin server
```


# Client

Chat client is a TCP client that connects to a server. It allows users to send text messages, images and files to other connected clients.

### Authentication
When client is started, it connects to the server on a given host and port. It then asks for a username and password to authenticate with the server.
If the user with a given username doesn't exist, it is created and user can login in the future. If the user exists, the password is verified agains the stored hash and
response is sent back to the client. Just follow the messages in the standard output.

If you enter an incorrect password, you need to enter username and password again.
```
Login failed, incorrect password.
Please try to log in again.
Enter your username.
```



### Sending messages
Once user is authenticated, it can send messages to other connected clients.
Text messages does not require any special commands and are sent as they are.

#### Commands
```
.file <FILE_PATH>       Send a file to other connected clients. The file is saved to the directory specified by `--output-dir` argument. If the file already exists, it is overwritten.
.image <IMAGE_PATH>     Send an image to other connected clients. If image is not in a .png format, it is converted to .png.
.quit                   Disconnect from the server and exit the client.
```
### Tracing
When client is started, debug tracing logs are saved to `./logs` directory. The output can be changed with argument `--logs-dir <LOGS_DIR>`.

### Running a client

```
$ cargo run --bin client 
```

Client can be started with these optional arguments:

```
Options:
      --host <HOST>                         Server Host [default: 127.0.0.1]
  -p, --port <PORT>                         Server Port [default: 11111]
  -o, --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>             Directory to save incoming files and images [default: ./data]
  -l, --logs-dir <LOGS_DIR>                 Directory to save tracing logs from client [default: ./logs]
  -u, --username <USERNAME>                 Username [default: anonymous]
  -h, --help                                Print help
  ```

# Running a server and client

Once you have a server and multiple clients running, you can send messages between them.
Typical logs from client looks like:

```
Connecting to server on 127.0.0.1:11111...
Enter your username.
Jiri
Enter your password. If you haven't registered yet, you will be registered with this username and password.
mysecretpassword
You were successfully registered.
Connected. You can now send messages.
--      Active users: 0      --
--      New user connected: Tomas      --
Ahoj Tome
Tomas: Ahoj, jak se mas?
dobre
.quit
```
